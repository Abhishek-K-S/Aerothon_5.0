We are team InnovateX. This is our solution to the Airbus 5.0 finale. 

## Proposed solution
The proposed solution involves streaming supply chain data of washing machine from various sources to Kylo, performing data transformation to remove redundancy and store the latest forecasted data. This way, there are no redundant data in the data lake, which helps in building a sustainable solution. Let's break down this solution into its various components and tools used.

#### Data Source:
The data is generated by the various departments of supply chain and is stored in Document database. This however can also be a relational database. The cuurent souce data comes from three different departments.
1) Fabrication
2) SubAssembly
3) Assembly
#### Data Streaming:
Streaming is the process of transferring data from its source to the target system in real-time. In this solution, supply chain data is streamed from various sources using tools called Apache NiFi which is built into Kylo.

#### Kylo:
Kylo is a data lake management platform that provides a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and monitoring data pipelines. In this solution, Kylo is used to ingest the supply chain data and perform data transformat.

#### Data Transformation:
Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format to another, cleaning and filtering data, and removing redundant data. In this solution, Kylo provides a wide range of data transformation tools such as Apache Spark, Apache NiFi, and Apache Hive.

#### Redundancy removal:
In this solution, the data is transformed to remove redundant data. This is achieved by keeping only the latest forecasted data and removing the older redundant data.The old data has no authenticity and thus can be removed.

#### Data Lake: 
A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data. In this solution, Kylo is used to build a data lake where the supply chain data is stored after removing redundancy.

Overall, this solution allows for the real-time streaming of supply chain data from various sources, transformation of the data to remove redundancy, and storage of the latest forecasted data in a centralized data lake using Kylo. This enables users to access clean and up-to-date data, which can be used for various business analytics and reporting purposes.
